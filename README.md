## Dataset Templates
Each dataset follows certain rules.
Attributes making up a class are all separated by ','. Attributes representing multiple values such as lists are separated by ';'. 
Attributes representing hashtables are represented in the following format:
```
Key>Value|Key>Value.
```
Each dataset has an id attribute which is an integer prepended with a character. Lacking this prepended character means the data when loaded will be unable to be sorted or searched through.
Below are the required prepended characters for each dataset type:
```
- BUS->B
- ROUTE->R
- STOPS->S
- TICKETS->T
- USERS->U
```
Empty attributes are represented by 'NULL'.
Times are stored in the following format:
```
'MM/DD/YYYY:HH:MM:SS'
```
